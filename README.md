# Database Backup Manager

A Laravel package for managing database backups. This package provides command-line tools to create and manage database backups in various formats including SQL, CSV, and JSON.

## Installation

To install the package in your Laravel project, run the following command:

```bash
composer require serkansyalcin/database-backup-manager
```
### Configuration
This package does not require any additional configuration beyond what is needed to connect to your database. Ensure that your .env file has the correct database connection settings.

### Usage
You can use the following artisan command to back up your database:
```bash
php artisan backup:database --format=sql
```
Replace sql with csv or json to get the backup in different formats.

#### Command Options
--format: Specifies the format of the backup. Supported formats are sql, csv, and json.
#### Examples
***SQL Backup***
To create a SQL backup of your database, run:
```bash
php artisan backup:database --format=sql
```

The resulting SQL backup file will be stored in the storage/app/backups directory with a filename like database-2024-08-23-08-27-40.sql.

***CSV Backup***
To create a CSV backup of your database, run:
```bash
php artisan backup:database --format=csv
```

The CSV backup will be stored in the storage/app/backups directory. Each table will be backed up with headers and data in CSV format.

***JSON Backup***
To create a JSON backup of your database, run:
```bash
php artisan backup:database --format=json
```

The JSON backup will be stored in the storage/app/backups directory. The backup will contain a JSON object with tables as keys and rows as values.

#### Common Issues
'mysqldump' is not recognized as an internal or external command: Ensure that mysqldump is installed and available in your system's PATH. If youâ€™re on Windows, you might need to add MySQL's bin directory to your PATH.

Directory not found: The package will automatically create the storage/app/backups directory if it does not exist.
